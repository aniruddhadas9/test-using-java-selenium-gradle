# test-using-java-selenium-gradle

This application is created for the beginers who want to start testing their application with selenium java web driver with gradle build 
and dependency project

#setup

1. import the poject as grade application in eclipse or intellij or any editor you like.
2. download the chrome driver (its different from chrome browser) which required for the testing of the application
3. run the test call or build the gradle project which will run the test cases in chrome browser.

# future addition

In the future we will add entire cucumber BDD setup to test any application in any web browser.
Below few points are in my mind now which need to be implemented.

1. added all configuration into the setup and tear down and post run and will move all configuration into it.
like creation of the driver and loading url into it.
2. setting of firefox browser so that it will have the capability of running the test cases in the firefox
3. cucumber BDD is not added yet which need to be added
